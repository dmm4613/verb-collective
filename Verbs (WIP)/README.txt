Within a verb is a user-friendly explanation of nearly every line in the code. If you ever feel confused or curious, reading through the commented section can help. For all of those that who cannot give two can see the raw code above the comments. You will always see the raw code first for easy access.

Basically, the basic layout of every verb documentation goes as follows:

1. Raw code
2. The point of this verb
3. Helpers and other shit that's the same
4. Unique code
5. Triggered verb code
6. Ways to expand on it
